## Meritocracy

    Competency provides results. Each human should sink or swim according to the quality of their work, not because of an arbitrary quota. After all, if one were in need of a surgery, should they prefer a doctor based on his performance, or because he prefers his salad to be tossed with a vinagarette dressing? If one can't see themself in any human's struggle, it's fair to say they're too far gone for even representation to help.

## Stratification

    Not everyone is created equally, but rather with varying amounts of strengths and weaknesses. Each fellow human being should be recognized in correlation to the quality of their work. A fact of life some aren't too willing to face head-on is that some people are better suited for some tasks than others. For those competent for the task, they should not have to deal with unfair restriction, and those less capable should prefer the path of hard work and helping out where possible, rather than giving up and slinging insults towards the competent.

## Exclusion

    Keep out the riff-raff. This is the foundation of freedom of association--to not only include those you find agreeable, but to exclude those who want nothing more than to see you drawn and quartered. For too long has gatekeeping been decried as evil, whilst hypocritically kicking out those who don't align perfectly with their own ideological crusades. We, instead choose to be honest with what we're doing. 

[^1]: For this specific case, I'll do my best to promise that any project I make, independent or not, will follow this guide to the best of my ability.
