Ah, hello there, internet person. I'm kinker31, or matrixDoppelg√§nger if you're not too comfy with the first name.
As you could probably tell from the repos I create and glacially maintain, I primairily deal with C. No C++, no C#, not even HolyC, just plain 'ol C.
(Save for any Minecraft mods I might make, one of which is for BTA.)

Don't worry though, I'm not the puritanical type, if you like Javascript, I won't blow a gasket.
Will say that C, or C++, serves as the main interpreter/compiler of a lot of the fancy-dancy languages use though.
Search your heart, you know it be true.

Also a Linux user, where problems can be solved with a simple sudo pacman -S.
(Not all of them, but a good few tho)
```

## int main()
```
{
initscr();
printw("Why stick to C in the first place though?\n"); refresh();
sleep(1);

A few reasons: It's Linux's language, it's simple to learn, compiles well into preformant assembly, and I also wanna make a DOS game someday.
Might post more details on my website.
